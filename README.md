## Project Ideas
A List of Possible Future Projects

- Developing a __Multithreaded 2D Chanel Flow Solver__ for the __Navier-Stokes Equations__, using the __Finite Difference Method__ and the __Successive Over-Relaxation Method__, in a variety of languages: e.g. __C__, __C++__, & __Fortran__. Will use the __OpenMP__ API for Multithreading.
- Developing a __Linear & Non-Linear Covective Heat Flow Solver__, in __C++__, using the __Finite Element Method__ and solved via the __Successive Over-Relaxation Method__.
- Employing __Fortran__ and the __GPU__ to build a __Linear/Non-Linear Shallow Water Equation Solver__.
-  __Physics-Informed Machine Learning__. Applying this to __Inverse Problems__ in __Geophysics__. E.g. __Seismic tomography__ and __Geomagnetism__.
-  Developing a __Compiler__ using __LLVM__.
-  Developing a __Compiler__ in __C/C++__.
-  Developing a __Multithreaded Linux Kernel__.
-  Developing an __Interpreter__ &/or __Compiler__ in __Go__.
-  Deloping a basic __Operating System__ in __C__.
-  __GPU Programming__ and __Fluid Dynamics__: Taking a look at the __SYCL Framework__ and using it to develop a solver.
-  Creating a simple __Crypto Trading Platform__ in __C++__.
-  Creating a __Cryptocurrency Trading Bot__ with a __User Interface__ in __Python__.
-  Creating a simple __Trading Bot__ in __Java__. I've never worked with __Java__ and I've always been put off by it; Might be a good time to see why!
-  Creating a basic __Online Oil & Gas Data Management System__ called ___OGManager___, developed in __Golang__.
-  Writing a solver for the __(Discrete) Fast Fourier Transform__ using __OpenCL__. I studied __Geophyics__ so I'm naturally interested in applications of __Signal Processing__.
-  Building a __RISC-V Operating System__ using __Rust__.
-  Building a __Shell__ in __Golang__.
-  Building a __Browser Engine__ in __Rust__.
-  Building my own __Container__ with __Golang__.
-  Building a simple __Terminal Emulator__ in __Golang__.
-  Creating a __Distributed Service__ in __Golang__.
